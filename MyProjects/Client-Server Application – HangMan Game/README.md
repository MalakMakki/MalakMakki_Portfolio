# Client-Server Application â€“ HangMan Game:
## Objective: Dive into a client-server application to focus on the request-response concept using Python.
## Description:
The first phase of the project involved general research about the client-server concept, followed by reviewing multiple programming examples of request and response packets in various programming languages such as Java, C#, and Python.
After choosing Python for the project, we began with a simple implementation of transferring a file between the client and server using the socket library, which contains important methods for such purposes.
In the final phase, we implemented the concept in a real-life scenario. We chose a game, "Hangman", where two clients compete to guess a mystery word. The communication with the server was based on the request-response model.
To make the project more realistic, we set up an Ethernet LAN as a hardware implementation and tested the client-server application on multiple laptops simultaneously.
## Results:
A strong foundation for the client-server application was built, along with a well-structured game that requires some UI/UX enhancements.
