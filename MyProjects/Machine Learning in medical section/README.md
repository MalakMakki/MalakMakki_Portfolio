# Machine Learning in medical section:
## Objective: Build high-performing regression and classification models aimed at advancing medical research and healthcare.
## Description:
The project is divided into two sections. The first section focuses on a regression model using supervised learning to predict a personâ€™s medical costs based on a representative database. The models used for prediction included Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model selection techniques were then employed based on performance evaluations.
The second section involved a classification model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on features such as age, blood pressure, and family history. Similar to the first section, we used Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost to compare performance.
## Results:
After comparing performance, all models used for diabetes classification achieved high accuracy, reaching 0.96. The regression models also showed strong performance.
