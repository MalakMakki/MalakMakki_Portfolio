# Arduino-Based smart parking system:
## Description:
The project initially aimed to familiarize us with microcontroller design and architecture, then integrate it into an electrical circuit to provide a real-life solution. Starting from the idea of saving people's time, we observed through statistics that a significant amount of time is wasted searching for a free parking slot in a city. 
To address this, we developed a smart parking system equipped with IR sensors, which serve as reliable data providers to detect whether parking slots are available. When a slot becomes free, the sensor detects it and communicates with the microcontroller, which then updates the availability display on a screen at the parking entrance. Additionally, if the parking lot is full, the microcontroller blocks the entrance motor to prevent cars from entering and wasting time searching for slots, especially in large parking areas. The figures below illustrate the hardware simulation before the system was implemented in reality.
The hardware phase was particularly interesting, enhancing our skills in hardware development. A detailed report is available explaining all aspects of this mini-project.
## Results:
We successfully developed a fully functional smart parking prototype that offers a cost-effective solution for small parking lots.
